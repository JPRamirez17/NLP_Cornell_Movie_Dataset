# Politecnico di Milano - Cornell Movie Dialog dataset Project

This repository contains the project work of a group of students from Politectnico di Milano who were assigned the Cornell Movie Dialog dataset for their NLP course. This dataset is a valuable resource for studying natural language understanding and generation in the context of movie dialogues. It offers insights into conversational patterns, linguistic style, emotion, and storytelling prevalent in movies across different genres.

## About the Dataset

The Cornell Movie Dialog Dataset is a collection of fictional conversations extracted from raw movie scripts, created by researchers at *Cornell University*
- 220,579 conversational exchanges between 10,292 pairs of movie characters
- involves 9,035 characters from 617 movies of various genres (comedy, drama, romance, science fiction)
- in total 304,713 utterances

## Goals

Our main objectives for this project include:

- Conduct comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the structure, content, and characteristics of the dataset.

- Apply various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and algorithms to analyze the dialogues within the dataset. (indexing, topic modeling, clustering, PoS tagging)

- Implement and compare various movie dialogue generation models (encoder-decoder, attention mechanisms, pre-trained models, fine-tuning).

- Build and evaluate classification regression models to predict metadata for movie dialogues (linear models, pre-trained models, fine-tuning).

- Develop a chatbot that can mimic the responses of a specific movie character, incorporating speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionalities for seamless interaction.
